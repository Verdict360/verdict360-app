Based on the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, fundamental rights are protected under the Bill of Rights in Chapter 2. Section 16 specifically addresses freedom of expression, while Section 9 deals with equality rights.

The Constitutional Court in [2019] ZACC 15 held that these rights must be balanced against other constitutional principles. Under South African law, any limitation of constitutional rights must meet the requirements of Section 36 of the Constitution.

Legal practitioners should note that the Supreme Court of Appeal in 2020 (3) SA 245 (SCA) emphasized the importance of ubuntu in constitutional interpretation. This reflects the unique nature of South African jurisprudence.

For specific legal advice, consult with a qualified South African attorney familiar with constitutional law.

Under the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, unfair dismissal disputes must be referred to the CCMA within 30 days of dismissal. Section 185 of the Act provides protection against unfair dismissal.

The Constitutional Court has established in recent judgments that fair procedures must be followed. The Labour Court has jurisdiction over labour disputes as provided in Section 157 of the Act.

Employees have the right to fair labour practices under Section 23 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. This includes protection against unfair dismissal and discrimination.

Remedies may include reinstatement or compensation as determined by the CCMA or Labour Court. Legal representation is recommended for complex labour disputes.

Under South African common law, derived from Roman-Dutch law, a valid contract requires consensus, capacity, formalities, and legality of performance. These essential elements were confirmed in numerous Supreme Court of Appeal decisions.

The doctrine of consensus ad idem requires a meeting of minds between contracting parties. Capacity relates to the legal ability to enter contracts, while formalities may be required by specific statutes.

The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 also impacts contract law through the Bill of Rights, particularly regarding unfair contract terms. Courts must consider constitutional values in contract interpretation.
